# RomanNumeralCalculator
This is a simple Roman numeral calculator and coverter. This program is menu driven and allows for two options when ran. The user can either select the converter or the calculator. 

Each of the two selections has their own submenus as well. The converter allows for users to choose whether they're converting from integer to Roman numerals or vice versa. The program then prints the conversion.

The calculator allows for users to choose whether they would like to calculate in either Roman numerals or integers. The output is then printed in the format that is decided by the user.
